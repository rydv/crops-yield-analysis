Understanding Crop Yields in India 
Goal: To explore data about crop production in India and use it to predict how much farmers can 
grow. 
Data: You'll use data about crops grown in India. It includes things like the type of crop, the 
season it was grown, how much land was used, how much was produced, and the amount of 
rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide used. 
What You Need to Do: 
1.  Get to Know the Data:  
○  Load the data and look at the values to understand what you have. 
○  Create simple plots (like bar charts or scatter plots) to visualize the data. 
○  Calculate basic statistics (like average and range) for the different factors. 
○  Create a Correlation Matrix: 
●  Using Pandas, calculate the correlation between all pairs of numerical 
features (including the target variable, Yield). This will create a 
correlation matrix. 
2. Generate the Heatmap: 
●  Use a Python library like Seaborn or Matplotlib to generate a heatmap 
from the correlation matrix. 
●  The heatmap will visually represent the correlation coefficients between 
features, with different colors indicating the strength and direction of the 
correlation (positive or negative). 
3. Focus on Relevant Features: 
●  In the heatmap, identify the features that have the strongest correlations 
with Yield. These are the most relevant features for predicting yield. 
●  Pay attention to both positive and negative correlations. 
4. Interpretation and Insights: 
●  Analyze the heatmap to understand the relationships between features. 
For example: 
○  A strong positive correlation between Fertilizer and Yield 
suggests that higher fertilizer usage is associated with higher 
yields. 
  A negative correlation between Pesticide and Yield might 
indicate that excessive pesticide use could negatively impact yield. 
 
2.  Find Groups of Similar Farms:  
○  Use a clustering technique (like K-means) to group farms based on things like the 
amount of land they use, rainfall, and fertilizer/pesticide usage. 
○  Describe what makes each group unique. 
○  Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method or silhouette 
score. (Optional) 
3.  Find Relationships:  
○  Look for relationships between different factors in the data. For example, does 
using more fertilizer usually mean a higher yield? 
○  You can use association rule mining for this (like the Apriori algorithm). 
4.  Make Recommendations: 
○  Based on what you've learned, suggest what farmers could do to improve your 
yields. 
○  For example, you could recommend certain crops for specific areas or suggest 
how much fertilizer to use 
1. Basis for Recommendations 
You should base your recommendations on the insights they've gained from the 
previous parts of the assignment: 
●  Yield Prediction: Which factors (rainfall, fertilizer, etc.) have the 
strongest influence on yield? Are there certain crops that consistently 
have higher yields than others? 
●  Clustering: Do certain groups of farms have noticeably higher or lower 
yields? What characterizes those groups? 
●  Association Rule Mining (if done): Are there any strong relationships 
between specific crops, practices (fertilizer/pesticide use), and yield 
outcomes? 
2. Types of Recommendations 
Here are some examples of the types of recommendations you could make: 
●  Crop-Specific Recommendations: 
○  "In areas with high rainfall, consider planting rice, as it tends to 
perform well in those conditions." 
 
○  "For regions with lower rainfall, crops like Arhar/Tur might be more 
suitable." 
●  Fertilizer and Pesticide Usage: 
○  "Optimize fertilizer usage based on the crop type. For example, 
rice may benefit from higher fertilizer application, while other crops 
might require less." 
○  "If possible, explore alternative pest control methods to reduce 
pesticide usage, which could have environmental benefits." 
●  Land Management: 
○  "Consider the size of your farm when choosing crops. Some crops 
might be better suited for smaller farms, while others thrive on 
larger areas." 
3. Data to Support Recommendations 
You should back up your recommendations with evidence from the data: 
●  Visualizations: Use charts and graphs to show the relationship between 
factors and yield. 
●  Statistics: Cite specific statistics (e.g., "Farms with higher rainfall had an 
average yield of X tons/hectare"). 
●  Model Results: Refer to the results of the prediction models (e.g., "The 
Random Forest model showed that rainfall was the most important 
predictor of yield"). 
●  Clustering Results: "Farms clustered in Group A, characterized by high 
fertilizer usage and specific crop choices, had significantly higher yields 
than other groups." 
●  Association Rules (if done): "The association rule analysis showed a 
strong link between high fertilizer use and high yield for rice crops.” 
 
5.  Write a Report:  
○  Summarize what you learned from the data. 
○  Which factors seem to affect crop yield the most? 
○  What are the characteristics of the farm groups you found? 
○  What recommendations can you make? 
○  What are the limitations of your analysis? 
Tools You Can Use: 
●  Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
